Mathematical epidemiology, the mathematical modeling of disease spread in a population, has a long history to be performed on a population which would compare the effects of different disease management strategies. Therefore, predictions based upon mathematical models may be essential in addressing the impact of communicable diseases and formulating strategies for fighting them and many early developments in the mathematical modeling of diseases are due to public health physicians. Mathematical epidemiology can aid medical professionals who are trying to manage diseases. During a disease outbreak ethical consideration make it impossible for medical experiments
